## Install

```

## Usage

### Git-Hook Installation

*coming soon*

### Gulp Integration

Guppy uses [lazypipe](https://github.com/OverZealous/lazypipe) to create pipelines
for git hooks. By requiring Guppy into your `gulpfile.js`, you can easily integrate
Gulp workflows as part of your git-hooks.

When git triggers a hook, guppy initializes the pipeline with the relevant files.

The `stream` method allows you to tap into pipelines.

```js
guppy.stream('pre-commit')
  .pipe(jshint)
  .pipe(jshint.reporter, stylish);
```

After setting up your pipelines, initialize Guppy to register the Guppy hooks as
Gulp tasks.

```js
guppy.init(gulp);
```

Once registered, you can specify task dependencies for Guppy hooks. If the hook 
is triggered, Gulp will run its dependencies first.

> This interface will be improved in the future.

```js
guppy.tasks['pre-commit'].dep.push('foo');
```
